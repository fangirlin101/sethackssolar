                Proposal:
            </h2>
            <h5>
              With an investment from up to the 15 largest economies in the world,
              and an evenly divided, one time cost covering the construction of a Saharan solar farm,
              the world’s entire energy source could be changed to solar.

            </h5>

            <br>
            <br>
            <h5>
                By investing in the development of this solar farm,
                these countries would then be put on a UN sponsored committee to manage this solar farm and the distribution of its energy.
                In addition to having the opportunity to be original investors, depending on where in the Sahara the solar farm is,
                at least one of Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Western Sahara, Sudan or Tunisia
                (all countries with territory including part of the sahara) would also be a committee member.
                The committee would also pay for the usage of this land.
            </h5>
            <br>
            <h5>
                Original investors would then gain the profits from selling this
                renewable energy to the rest of the world. Given the natural trajectory
                towards renewable energy usage and the influential economic powers of the investors,
                this market will become increasingly relevant and competitive. As a UN affiliated committee,
                abuse of pricing will not be permitted, and all rates will be equal-to or less than the pricing of non-renewable energies such as coal or gas,
                in order to provide affordable clean energy to developing countries.
            </h5>
            <br>
            <h5>
                Through this model, it is possible to facilitate the transition to clean energy without sacrificing economic growth.
